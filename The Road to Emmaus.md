## Pre / Post revelation 
#### plus I will point out some principles we can hang our hats on along the way

### Principles 

* The context of this story is historical 
* They were kept from recognizing him

Jeremihia 

```11For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. 12Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.```

### Pre-Revelation

The basic problem is glaring at us in verse 21 

```but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel```

* Verse 25

Aren't you failing to understand ALL that the prophets have spoken - Jesus asked  

Their faith was already a pastence thing

    Their dreams shattered 
    Their hopes were gone
    They were already burried 

They only got half of the picture.
the idea of victory and glory appealed to them but they failed to see that these thing lay on the path of dying to self

### What does the scripture tell us about suffering 

[Suffering](https://www.biblestudytools.com/topical-verses/bible-verses-about-suffering/)


#### vs 25 - 27
The Christ had to suffer

Acts 17

```1 When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. 2As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 3explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead.```

### Post

#### vs 28 - 29
Stay with us. The day is almost over. It's dangerous out there.

#### God chose the ordinary in this instance to reveal Christ to these two 

#### vs 30 
The two gave Him the honor of being the host.
