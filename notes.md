Luke's "only" detailed narative of the resurection
    Historical event that none of the gospels record

    It was just another day (A good sermon title)

Context of this story

The message of Christianity is Historical 

    These things actually happened. 

Rational 
(getting the big picture 14:11)

3 questions vs 17 - 19

    * What are you discussing 
    * Are you the only one in Jerusalem that does not know the things that have happened there in these days?
    * What things?
    
They were talking about the identity of Jesus
    
    He was prophet Powerful in Word and Deed
#### vs 19 - 24


Struggle between Hope and Fear

    Do we have a grasp of why we even exists 

    Why do we never get answer to a 1000 different questions 

    I'm looking for someone to change my life

    Is it just for the moment we live.

    I am a rock and an Island

    ### Can we identify with these 2 in Scripture

    2 Points 

## Basic problem

## Big Picture

### What is the basic problem
    
    We had hoped he was the one?

    Vs 13 

    11K between Jerusalem and Emmaus (7Miles)

    The same day as the previous chapter, the same day as the empty tomb

    The 2 are talking about everything that have happened.

    This is history not mythology inveneted a few 100 years after some person named Jesus of Nazareth lived

    There is no doubt in Lukes mind that Jesus of history and the Jesus of faith are one in the same.

    Where did Jesus go if he was not in the tomb
    What was happening in Crusifiction
    Why did he make all of these amazing statements 
    What did Jesus mean when he told that guy next to him "today you will be with me in Paradise" 
    Is he the fulfillment of the things that he said

    Luke Chapter 4 from go back to Gallalie and back to Nazareth
    What does he do there, He goes to the synagog.  That was his custom.  And he reads from Isiah 

    Vs 15 - they are joined by a stranger 

    They were kept from recognizing him.  
        We can not see the reason Christ unless he wills to disclose himself.  

    What's the word on the street?  

## We had hoped that he was the one to redeem ISREAL 

HIM THEY DID NOT SEE

# THE BIG PICTURE

Aren't you failing to understand and slow to believe ALL the prohets have spoken?

The attached themself to glory and victory but they failed to see that these things are at the end of the path of suffering and death 

Cross ref Luke 18:31

Jesus did not hide this, if you follow me this is a radical change in your life.  

vs 27 a bible study about ALL
