### Jesus the light of the World" 
#### John 8 

Here in chapter 7 and 8 We have the Feast of Booths

Feast were important to the Jewish people.

It's my understanding that on the last day of the Feast it was known as the Illimination fo the temple
The poeple were there to participate in the illumination of the temple

4 huge menorahs/candelabras (seventy-five feet high) ```just shy of 23 meters``` lighted in the Temple at night to remind the people of the pillar of fire that had guided them in their wilderness journey. All night long they shone in their brilliance, illuminating the entire city"

light was a reminder of God's goodness
it was a reminder of God delivering them out of Eqypt 

They were filled with expectation of these events 

It is in this back drop that Jesus makes this claim 

```John 8:12 "â€œI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."```

A remarkable claim
Incredible promiss

### The Material we call the Gosple Book
what we have here is material that was accumulated after the assention of Jesus

John has chosen to start his not with the birth narative but back into eternity if you will, how God has reveal himself in eternity and how out of the darkness the light has come.  John 1:4   Vs 9

Jesus is making the claim that we live in darkness.  People tend to say no I don't live in darkness.  

This really annoyed the religious.  Hey, does this guy know who we are?  Who is he to say that we live in darkness.  We are fine
let me tell ya, you are not fine.  it is an illutions if we are honest of one second you would admit that 

You love youself too much
You don't love God
you think fillthy thoughts
and you are outragious to the people around us
You live in darkness

And I'm only addressing us men for the moment 

John 3:19
```...  men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. ```

### this is the reality that Jesus is making 

and that is the point Jesus says that If you follow me you will walk in the light.

Sparklers as a kid

we by our very nature are unlite sparklers

Ephesians 5:8 ```for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. ```

Are you, am I?  Have you come to our lord saying my thought are dark, my way is dark, my end is dark?  Illuminate me Lord

I want to be your follower and be change like Zacchaeus His life was dark wasn't it

The light came and over came the darkness

```Walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true),```


what dull our lights 
- willful sin
- compromise 
- lazyness
- fear

we are suppose to be salt and our lights are suppose to shine


```
Isaiah 9:2 New International Version (NIV)
2 The people walking in darkness
    have seen a great light;
on those living in the land of deep darkness
    a light has dawned.
```
