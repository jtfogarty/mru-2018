## Scripture 
Ephesians 4:11-13
```11So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 13until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.```

Philippians 3:7-13
```7But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 9and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— 10that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.12Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 15Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. 16Only let us hold true to what we have attained.```

## Pray

## Speak
I want to take a few minutes and talk about Maturity In Christ.

Colossians 1
```28He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.```

* What does it mean to be Mature in Christ
* What are some of it charicteristics

### We have the example of Christ to follow

This may seem obvious and I sure it is 

* What charicture traits did Jesus have?  

### Jesus knew who he was? 
John 13:3 ```Jesus, knowing that the Father had gien all things into his hands, and that he had come from the God and was going back to God```

Who are you?  
Philp vs 12

Paul expands on this with humility.  
### Aware of what we are not
#### There is great line in the move Spiderman movive....

...

Paul also expounds on this by adding. 

A healthy discregard for the past vs 13

### What lies ahead.

“You did not choose me, but I chose you to go and bear fruit (John 15:16)

Go where? What are we to do?  Where are we to live?  

John 17:4 ```I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. ```

### Serve
vs 4 ```rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. 5Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him```
